## Problems with reference sequence
<details>
  <summary><h3>MEG_3594</h3></summary>
  Reference sequence in CARD is from a different species than the reference sequence in article listed
  <ul>
    <li>CARD sequence is S. lincolnensis, which produced lincomycin; its lmrA is intrinsically resistant to lincomycin</li>
    <li>Article sequence is B. subtilis which can acquire resistance in its lmrA gene through SNP</li>
    <li>SNP information for MEG_3594 is still included in SNPInfo database but is never used by the SNP_Verification program</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Information is based on article sequence</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><h3>MEG_3994</h3></summary>
  Despite being an rRNA sequence, the reference nucleotide sequence retrieved from CARD contains amino acid residues
</details>
<details>
  <summary><h3>MEG_5779</h3></summary>
  Reference sequence in CARD is different from sequence in MEGARes
  <ul>
    <li>CARD sequence is a phosphatidyltransferase called pgsA</li>
    <li>MEGARes sequence is a capsular polyglutamate synthetase called capA which is also known as pgsA in NCBI</li>
    <li>SNP information for MEG_5779 is still included in SNPInfo database but is never used by the SNP_Verification program</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Info is based on CARD sequence</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
